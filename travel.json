Video by and <ORG> This unique idol of Lord <ORG>a is located on Mountain Dholkal in Chhattisgarh\u2019s Dantewada at the height of around 3000 feet. The idol, brilliantly carved out of stone, was the victim of the systematic vandalism and destruction of Hindu icons and objects of worship recently, when it was vandalised by Maoists in 2017. But the Maoists could not kill the divinity of the idol and the mountaintop, and devotees complete a difficult trek to climb 3000 feet on foot to reach the idol to have a darshan and worship it. The idol was carved and installed in the 11th century and was worshipped regularly. But with time it went out of people\u2019s memory and got covered by trees, and remained hidden for many years until it was rediscovered by the British in 1943 before opening the Bailadila mines. The idol is around 3 feet tall and weighs more than 500 kgs. The <ORG> idol, carved from a solid piece of granite, is perched on its beautiful circular perch amid the deep, impenetrable woods of Bastar in Chhattisgarh\u2019s Dantewada region. However, post-independence, the idol got vanished from public memory again until the year 2012 when a journalist marched on a trek into the dense forest leading to the Dholkal mountain peak.

Back in 2014, my dad visited Iceland on a work trip, well before <ORG> music video and our very own \u2018Gerua\u2019 catapulted it to mass social media popularity. Even my dad\u2019s \u2019dad-photos\u2019 made our jaws drop. He sent us a grainy <ORG> photo of Sk\u00f3gafoss and my brother and I were stumped. Only a few months later, our family found itself in Iceland to celebrate my dad\u2019s 60th birthday. That\u2019s when my romance with Iceland, and dare I say, traveling itself began. I\u2019ve always felt that Iceland\u2019s waterfalls aren\u2019t just a visual delight- calling them just that would be reducing the sheer power, wonder and magic they hold. These waterfalls will activate all your senses on overdrive. Summer or winter, they come as a full package with the landscapes that adorn them. Lush green or snow white, with unique layers and patterns, flowing with such force you\u2019re stunned and arrested on the spot.

There\u2019s probably THOUSANDS of them all around this tiny, precious country. But some of them have names and are more popular than the others, and also more accessible. I\u2019ve name-tagged the ones and I made it to last year. The ones we missed that were on our list?- Hengifoss, Svartifoss (I hiked to see it back in 2015!), H\u00e1ifoss and Klifbrekkufossar.

This frequency is needed because lion breeding has a low fertility rate in general \ud83e\udd81 Male cats have spines on their little big guys down there, to cause slight trauma to the lioness upon withdrawal. The resulting pain is what triggers ovulation. OUCH! \ud83e\udd81 The Gestation period is between 100-180 days, and once the cubs come, the lioness doesn\u2019t mate again for 2 years or so I can\u2019t BELIEVE I casually witnessed this on my sunrise safari at Kruger national park, just hours before my flight out of South Africa! My parents and fam ditched me because they were tired (all 5 of them!), but I refused to cancel so my safari guide and I had a grand old time in the wee hours of the morning.

On the final day of the group trip, we finally saw two of them. We spent close to 2 hours to let them get comfortable with the only two boats (ours) out at the Banda Sea, until they began to come up in a pattern we observed and learnt from our excellent team of guides. And finally, towards the end, the <ORG> said we could jump in, only 3-4 at a time. And we did. And I first saw it all alone when I jumped in without fins and a snorkel (long story!)

That day was reserved for feeling Compersion in the joy of all of my fellow divers \ud83e\udd79 But for the next 3 days, these elusive <ORG> put up a show I will forever hold close to my heart. Everyday, we saw them EVERYDAY since. Casually passing by our dive resort, en route a dive site 10 minutes from our resort, during a surface interval\u2026just, anywhere and everywhere. I even began to spot them first everyday, once I learnt how to from our skilled crew. Nature is magic. To bestow upon us these gentle beings who are the LARGEST animals to exist on our Planet.

The road was built to deliver prisoners to the gold mines and prison camps of Kolyma - an area rich in natural resources. As the road is built on permafrost, the popular rumor spread that burying people into the fabric of the road was more practical than digging new holes to bury the bodies of the dead. Untold numbers died constructing the highway across the frozen ground. Prisoners said that there was one body for each tree cut down to clear the forest. The average lifespan of prisoners here was 6 months. The road now snakes through the wilderness of the Russian Far East. It passes through vistas of harsh beauty dotted with frozen, unmarked graves. The road now has rapidly vanishing traces of labor camps. It\u2019s deemed the world\u2019s most dangerous road because people frequently die while traversing this road.

The crazy part is suddenly these parts were warm (-8 to -20 degrees) for a few days before and I went. And we were so BUMMED. But as soon as we showed up, the temperatures plummeted to -64 degrees!!!! Like WTFFFF! We were soooo happy hahaha cuz the whole point was to FEEL those temperatures like really FEEEEL them!! \ud83e\udd2a What is it like to be in those temperatures? It goes from <ORG> to straight up <ORG>. There\u2019s no in between!! \ud83e\udd76\ud83d\ude02 But honestly it was SO worth it, I\u2019ve never felt this temperature before, never gone to a place that has blown my mind with how people just go about their daily lives like it\u2019s nothing and how they LIVE and not just EXIST. Cherry on top was when (one of the very few guides in the area) told us we were the first Indian girls to do this. \ud83e\udd2d HUGE thank you to our lovely guides Eugene and Tanya and also and who helped us cope with these crazy temperatures and took such amazing care of us. Forever grateful to you guys!! \u2764\ufe0f And yes regular Indian winter wear does NOT work. We had to rent jackets and boots. But yeah, drop your questions below and I\u2019ll make a detailed reel on them soon!! \ud83e\udd76\u2764\ufe0f",

Magical Northern Lights, igloo stays, ice floating in the Arctic Ocean, meeting huskies and reindeer, all these experiences have been on my bucket list since forever! But when I saw the prices in Finland, I knew I had to look for a cheaper option. That\u2019s when I found Russia, offering the SAME experiences for <ORG> the price! Here\u2019s how much you can actually save!! \u2728 Northern Lights Tour Finland: \u20b912K | Russia: \u20b96K \ud83e\uddca Ice Floating Finland: \u20b910K | Russia: \u20b98K \ud83e\udd8c Reindeer Sleigh Ride Finland: \u20b99K | Russia: \u20b91.5K \ud83d\udc15 Husky Sledding Finland: \u20b910K | Russia: \u20b95K **For husky and reindeer sledding - Please do some research and make sure to find an ethical one - I skipped the ones in Murmansk cuz they treated the animals v badly and there were too many tourists doing it. Ended up doing it in another part of Russia where it was a part of the locals\u2019 life and not a tourist trap. \u2708\ufe0f Flights India to Helsinki: \u20b980K (Return) India to Murmansk: \u20b960K (Return) \ud83d\udec2 Visa Finland: <ORG> \u20b98K (Hard to get) Russia: 6k <ORG> for 16 days (Super easy!)
