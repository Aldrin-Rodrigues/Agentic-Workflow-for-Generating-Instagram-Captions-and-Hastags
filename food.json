For someone whose life plan had always been to take up a job, like everyone else in my family, working as an independent creator was scary. I didn\u2019t know how much revenue I\u2019d be able to generate each month or how long I\u2019d be able to sustain it for before I\u2019ve to get a \u201creal job\u201d. I still have days when I ask my self if I\u2019m doing enough. If what I\u2019m doing is making any kind of impact and then when I see things like this happen, it just all feels right. In the last few years, I\u2019ve achieved and experienced things I never even dreamt about when I was starting out. I was only doing what made me happy and giving it all I have.

We hand-fed geese and watched wonder unfold in their eyes. We wandered through green paths that felt like stories \u2014 Every branch a whisper, every leaf a teacher. The chefs even brought the magic into the kitchen \u2014 inviting the kids in for hands-on sessions, where dough turned into laughter and recipes became memories. And somehow\u2026 we never once looked at the clock. And the food \u2014 It wasn\u2019t just a meal. It was memory, served warm. Delicate crab, smoky snapper, buttery lobster \u2014 Every plate carried intention. The chefs weren\u2019t just preparing dinner. They were pouring soul into silence. No itinerary. No pressure. Just honest moments held gently together \u2014 And a team of butlers and chefs extraordinaires who redefined what it means to truly care. Between barefoot dinners, tangled sheets, sea salt on our skin, and steaming mugs of cocoa \u2014 I caught a glimpse of who my sons are becoming. And in that softness, maybe\u2026 I found a new piece of myself too. This wasn\u2019t a stay.
